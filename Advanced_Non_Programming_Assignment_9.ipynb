    "\n",
    "7. “latin-1” is another significant ASCII-compatible encoding, as it maps byte values directly to the first 256 Unicode code points. (Note that Windows has it’s own “latin-1” variant called cp1252, but, unlike the ISO “latin-1” implemented by the Python codec with that name, the Windows specific variant doesn’t map all 256 possible byte values)\n",
