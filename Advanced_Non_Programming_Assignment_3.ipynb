    "An abstract class can be considered as a blueprint for other classes. It allows to create a set of methods that must be created within any child classes built from the abstract class.\n",

    "An abstract superclass is the common superclass for several subclasses. Factor up common behavior. Define the methods they all respond to. Methods that subclasses should implement are declared abstract.\n",

    "An abstract superclass is one way to provide re-usable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can extend the abstract class and inherit the code. This is sometimes more convenient than using static methods or object composition to share code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The abstract class can \"fix\" parts of the code (by making it final). This is called the \"template method\" pattern (and this is not possible with an interface, which cannot provide final methods).\n",

    "Of course, we can achieve both with a non-abstract superclass as well.\n",

    "An abstract class has the additional benefit that it does not have to provide a complete implementation (that would make sense to instantiate on its own), some parts can be left specified, but unimplemented (the abstract methods).\n",
