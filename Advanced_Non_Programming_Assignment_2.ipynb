  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism, and object association are most important concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation\n",
    "The word, “encapsulate,” means to enclose something. Just like a pill \"encapsulates\" or contains the medication inside of its coating, the principle of encapsulation works in a similar way in OOP: by forming a protective barrier around the information contained within a class from the rest of the code.\n",
    "In OOP, we encapsulate by binding the data and functions which operate on that data into a single unit, the class. By doing so, we can hide private details of a class from the outside world and only expose functionality that is important for interfacing with it. When a class does not allow calling code access to its private data directly, we say that it is well encapsulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Elaborating on the person class example from earlier, we might have private data in the class, such as \"socialSecurityNumber,\" that should not be exposed to other objects in the program. By encapsulating this data member as a private variable in the class, outside code would not have direct access to it, and it would remain safe within that person’s object.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a method is written in the person class to perform, say, a bank transaction called \"bankTransaction(),\" that function could then access the \"socialSecurityNumber\" variable as necessary. The person’s private data would be well encapsulated in such a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "In OOP, polymorphism allows for the uniform treatment of classes in a hierarchy. Therefore, calling code only needs to be written to handle objects from the root of the hierarchy, and any object instantiated by any child class in the hierarchy will be handled in the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because derived objects share the same interface as their parents, the calling code can call any function in that class’ interface. At run-time, the appropriate function will be called depending on the type of object passed leading to possibly different behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Suppose we have a class called, “Animal” and two child classes, “Cat,” and “Dog.” If the Animal class has a method to make a noise, called, “makeNoise,” then, we can override the \"makeNoise\" function that is inherited by the sub-classes, \"Cat\" and \"Dog,\" to be “meow” and “bark,” respectively. Another function can, then, be written that accepts any Animal object as a parameter and invokes its \"makeNoise\" member function. The noise will be different: either a “meow” or a “bark” depending on the type of animal object that was actually passed to the function."
