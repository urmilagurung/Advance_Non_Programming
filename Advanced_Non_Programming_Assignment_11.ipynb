In order to understand metaclasses well, one needs to have prior experience working with Python classes. Before we dive deeper into metaclasses, let's get a few concepts out of the way."

In a nutshell, we can say metaprogramming is the code that manipulates code. In this article, we are going to discuss Metaclasses, why and when we should use them, and what are the alternatives. This is a fairly advance Python topic and the following prerequisite is expected –\n",
