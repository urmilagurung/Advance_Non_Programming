    "Composition basically enables us for creating complex types objects by combining other types of objects in the program. Composition represents ‘has a relationship’ type or we can call composition as ‘has a relationship’ in the OOPs concept. It means that a composite class present in the program can contains the objects from the other class components and this type of relationship model is called as has a relationship.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "n Python, the composition allows us to reuse the implementation of the component class object in the composite classes. We have to remember that the composite class is not actually inheriting the component class interface but it is adapting the interface of instances of component class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The composition relationship in Python between composite class and component class is considered as loosely coupled. It means that if we make changes in component class, it will rarely affect the composite class and if we make changes in the composite class, it will never affect the component class. This feature of composition in Python provides us better adaptability with the changes. It also allows us to introduce new changes in the application according to the requirements without affecting the existing code."
