Normally, Python uses methods like getters and setters to adjust the values on attributes without any special processing. It’s just a basic storage system. Sometimes, You might need to validate the values that are being assigned to a value. A descriptor is a mechanism behind properties, methods, static methods, class methods, and super()."
